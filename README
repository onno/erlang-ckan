Erlang wrapper around the CKAN API.

The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is is a 
web-based system for the storage and distribution of data, such as 
spreadsheets and the contents of databases supported by the 
Open Knowledge Foundation. It is inspired by the package management 
capabilities common to open source operating systems like Linux, 
and is intended to be the "apt-get of Debian for data".

The system is used both as a public platform on ckan.net and in 
various government data catalogues, such as the UK's [data.gov.uk], 
Norway's [data.norge.no] and the Dutch national data register.

The ckan erlang module allows readonly access to the REST API of 
a CKAN repository. At this moment there is no support for
adding or updating. This module uses version 2 of the CKAN API.
